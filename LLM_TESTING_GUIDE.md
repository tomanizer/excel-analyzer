## üîß Advanced Testing Techniques

### 1. **Comparative Analysis**
Test multiple Excel files and compare:
```bash
# Extract multiple files
python excel_extractor.py file1.xlsx
python excel_extractor.py file2.xlsx
python excel_extractor.py file3.xlsx

# Use LLM to compare
"Compare these three Excel files and identify patterns, differences, and recommendations for standardization."
```

### 2. **Template Generation**
Use LLM to create templates based on analysis:
```bash
# Extract existing model
python excel_extractor.py existing_model.xlsx

# Use LLM prompt
"Based on this Excel model structure, create a template specification for similar models."
```

### 3. **Code Generation**
Use LLM to generate Python code based on Excel logic:
```bash
# Extract Excel file
python excel_extractor.py financial_model.xlsx

# Use LLM prompt
"Convert the key calculations from this Excel model into Python code with pandas."
```

## Complex Calculation Errors

### 1. Hidden Rows/Columns in Data Ranges

**Issue**: Data ranges include hidden rows/columns that contain incorrect or outdated values.

**Impact**: Calculations use wrong data without users realizing, leading to incorrect results.

**Example**:
```
SUM(A1:A100) includes hidden rows with old data
```

**Detection Challenge**: Need to check if ranges include hidden cells and verify data integrity.

**Severity**: 游댮 **HIGH**

---

### 2. Circular References in Named Ranges

**Issue**: Named ranges that reference each other in a circular manner.

**Impact**: Can cause infinite calculation loops or incorrect results.

**Example**:
```
Named Range "Revenue" = SUM(Expenses)
Named Range "Expenses" = Revenue * 0.8
```

**Detection Challenge**: Complex dependency mapping across multiple named ranges.

**Severity**: 游댮 **HIGH**

---

### 3. Inconsistent Date Formats in Date Calculations

**Issue**: Mixed date formats (text vs. actual dates) in date-based calculations.

**Impact**: Date arithmetic returns errors or wrong results.

**Example**:
```
"01/01/2024" (text) vs 01/01/2024 (date)
=DATEDIF("01/01/2024", TODAY(), "D") # Returns error
```

**Detection Challenge**: Need to identify cells that should be dates but are stored as text.

**Severity**: 游리 **MEDIUM**

---

### 4. Array Formula Spill Errors

**Issue**: Array formulas that can't spill properly due to insufficient space or conflicts.

**Impact**: Formulas return #SPILL! errors or partial results.

**Example**:
```
=UNIQUE(A1:A100) # Spills into occupied cells
```

**Detection Challenge**: Need to check spill ranges and potential conflicts.

**Severity**: 游리 **MEDIUM**

---

### 5. Volatile Functions in Large Models

**Issue**: NOW(), TODAY(), RAND(), OFFSET(), INDIRECT() causing excessive recalculations.

**Impact**: Model becomes slow and may produce inconsistent results.

**Example**:
```
=INDIRECT("A" & ROW()) # Recalculates on every change
```

**Detection Challenge**: Identifying performance impact of volatile functions.

**Severity**: 游리 **MEDIUM**

---

### 6. Cross-Sheet Reference Errors

**Issue**: References to cells in other sheets that have been moved/deleted.

**Impact**: #REF! errors or references to wrong cells.

**Example**:
```
=Sheet1!A1 # Sheet1 was renamed or A1 was deleted
```

**Detection Challenge**: Tracking dependencies across multiple sheets.

**Severity**: 游댮 **HIGH**

---

### 7. Data Type Inconsistencies in Lookup Tables

**Issue**: Mixed data types in lookup tables (numbers stored as text, etc.).

**Impact**: VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP/XLOOKUP return wrong results or errors.

**Example**:
```
VLOOKUP table: "123" (text) vs 123 (number)
```

**Detection Challenge**: Identifying data type mismatches in lookup ranges.

**Severity**: 游댮 **HIGH**

---

### 8. Conditional Formatting Overlap Conflicts

**Issue**: Multiple conditional formatting rules that conflict or overlap.

**Impact**: Visual confusion and potential calculation issues.

**Example**:
```
Rule 1: A1:A100 > 0 (green)
Rule 2: A1:A100 < 0 (red)
Rule 3: A1:A100 = 0 (yellow) # Conflicts with Rule 1
```

**Detection Challenge**: Analyzing rule precedence and conflicts.

**Severity**: 游릭 **LOW**

---

### 9. External Data Connection Failures

**Issue**: Links to external databases or files that are broken or outdated.

**Impact**: Models use stale or missing data.

```

**Detection Challenge**: Identifying calculations that need special precision handling.

**Severity**: 游리 **MEDIUM**

---

## Range Incomplete Formula Errors

### 1. Incomplete Formula Drag (Formula Cutoff)

**Issue**: Developer drags formula down but stops short, leaving cells without formulas.

**Impact**: Missing calculations for remaining rows, leading to incomplete totals.

**Example**:
```
Revenue calculation formula in A1:A100, but only dragged to A50
Rows A51:A100 have no formulas
```

**Detection**: Find formula patterns that suddenly stop mid-range.

**Severity**: 游댮 **HIGH**

---

### 2. False Range End Detection (Empty Cell Trap)

**Issue**: Empty cell in middle of data range makes developer think it's the end.

**Impact**: Missing calculations for data beyond the empty cell.

**Example**:
```
Data in A1:A100, but A50 is empty
Formula only covers A1:A49, missing A51:A100
```

**Detection**: Identify gaps in data ranges and check if formulas extend beyond them.

**Severity**: 游댮 **HIGH**

---

### 3. Partial Formula Propagation (Missing Edge Cases)

**Issue**: Developer copies formula to most cells but misses one or more.

**Impact**: Inconsistent calculations, especially dangerous in totals/sums.

```
Copying A1:A10 but accidentally missing A5
```

**Detection**: Find gaps in formula sequences.

**Severity**: 游리 **MEDIUM**

---

### 7. Formula Range vs Data Range Discrepancy

**Issue**: Formulas reference ranges that don't match the actual data extent.

**Impact**: Lookups fail or return wrong results for data beyond the range.

**Example**:
```
VLOOKUP table range is A1:B50 but data goes to B100
```

**Detection**: Compare referenced ranges with actual data boundaries.

**Severity**: 游댮 **HIGH**

---

## Formula Reference Anchoring Errors

### 1. Missing Dollar Sign Anchors (Relative Reference Errors)

**Issue**: Formula should have absolute references but uses relative references.

**Impact**: References shift incorrectly when copied, causing wrong calculations.

**Example**:
```
=A1*B1 should be =$A$1*B1 when copying down
```

**Detection**: Identify formulas that should be anchored based on usage patterns.

**Severity**: 游댮 **HIGH**

---

### 2. Wrong Row/Column Anchoring (Partial Lock Errors)

**Issue**: Dollar sign on wrong part of reference.

**Impact**: Formulas copy incorrectly, creating calculation errors.

**Examples**:
```
=$A1 when it should be =A$1 (locked column, should lock row)
=A$1 when it should be =$A1 (locked row, should lock column)
=$A$1 when it should be =A1 (over-locked, should be relative)
```

**Detection**: Analyze anchoring patterns and identify inconsistencies.

**Severity**: 游댮 **HIGH**

---

### 3. Over-Anchored References (Unnecessary Absolute)

**Issue**: Dollar signs on references that should be relative.

**Impact**: Formula doesn't adapt when copied, missing the intended pattern.

**Example**:
```
=$A$1+$B$1 in every cell when it should be =A1+B1
```

**Detection**: Identify over-anchored references that should be relative.

**Severity**: 游리 **MEDIUM**

---

### 4. Inconsistent Anchoring in Ranges

**Issue**: Mixed anchoring within the same formula.

**Impact**: Range expands incorrectly when copied.

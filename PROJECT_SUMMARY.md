# CFO Models - Excel to Python Conversion Tool

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an automated or semi-automated process for converting 300 financial and accounting Excel models into standardized Python code. The tool reads Excel workbooks and their accompanying documentation to extract model logic, dependencies, and processes, then generates Python skeletons or complete implementations.

## Core Vision

Transform complex Excel-based financial models into maintainable, testable Python code while preserving the original logic and relationships. The goal is to achieve 80% automation with manual refinement for the remaining 20%.

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1: Structural Analysis (Algorithmic)
The tool performs comprehensive structural analysis of Excel workbooks using a multi-layered approach:

#### 1. Table Discovery
- **Formal Tables**: Identifies Excel ListObjects (structured tables) as primary data containers
- **Informal Islands**: Uses flood-fill algorithm to detect contiguous data blocks
- **Bounding Box Analysis**: Calculates precise ranges and relationships

#### 2. Relationship Mapping
- **VLOOKUP Detection**: Parses formulas to identify cross-table lookups
- **External Links**: Detects references to other workbooks
- **Formula Dependencies**: Maps cell-to-cell relationships

#### 3. Advanced Structure Detection
- **Named Ranges**: Identifies user-defined variables and constants
- **Data Validation**: Detects input cells with validation rules
- **Charts**: Maps visualization data sources
- **Pivot Tables**: Identifies pivot table data sources and reports
- **VBA Macros**: Detects presence of macro-enabled workbooks

### Phase 2: Semantic Analysis (AI-Enhanced)
- **Table Classification**: AI categorizes tables as inputs, calculations, or outputs
- **Data Flow Synthesis**: Generates high-level model descriptions
- **Code Translation**: Converts Excel formulas to Python operations

## Key Features

class FinancialModel:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str):
        """Initialize model with configuration"""
        self.config = self.load_config(config_path)
        self.data = {}
        
    def run_model(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Execute the financial model logic"""
        # Generated calculation logic here
        pass
        
    def load_config(self, path: str) -> dict:
        """Load model configuration from YAML/JSON"""
        pass
```

## Technical Implementation

## Development Approach

### Modular Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function has one clear purpose
- **Testable Components**: Isolated logic for unit testing
- **Functional Style**: Prefer composition over inheritance
- **Vectorized Operations**: Use pandas/NumPy over pure Python loops

### Code Quality Standards
- **Logging**: Use logging instead of print statements
- **Docstrings**: Restructured text format documentation
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotation support
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with meaningful messages

### CLI Interface
```bash
# Basic analysis
python excel_parser.py --file model.xlsx

# Comprehensive analysis with AI
python excel_parser.py --file model.xlsx --ai --output python_skeleton.py

# Batch processing
python excel_parser.py --directory ./models --batch
```

- **Challenge**: Excel formulas can reference multiple sheets, external files, and named ranges
- **Solution**: Robust regex patterns and openpyxl's formula parsing capabilities

### 2. Table Boundary Detection
- **Challenge**: Excel data isn't always in formal tables; informal data blocks need detection
- **Solution**: Flood-fill algorithm to find contiguous data islands

### 3. Relationship Mapping
- **Challenge**: Understanding how different parts of the model connect
- **Solution**: Dependency graph construction and cross-reference analysis
